This is somewhat of a nuisance.\\n All of the Jonin are out on S-rank missions,\\n and 90% of the main Chunin and Genin have been allocated elsewhere.\\n Who\\u2019s left?\\n Let\\u2019s see\\u2026well\\u2026\\n Multi-Clone Jutsu!\\n Let\\u2019s go, Bushy Brows!\\n Here goes, Naruto!\\n Leaf Hurricane!\\n You jerk!\\n Another serving of Shadow Clones for you!\\n You ain\\u2019t seen nothing yet!\\n You let your guard down!\\n Pretty good, Bushy Brow\\u2026\\n The same to you, Naruto\\u2026\\n Naruto!

I\\u2019ll show \\u2018em how great Leaf Ninja are!\\n \\u2013Got it! \\u2013Let\\u2019s give it a shot!\\n All right!

Me? That\\u2019s a stupid thing to say.\\n It\\u2019s my mission to guard this guy. Why would I?!\\n Yeah, I guess.\\n Even if he is a criminal,\\n you can\\u2019t just kill him off without interrogating him first.\\n A brat talking like he knows, huh?\\n There isn\\u2019t any need to interrogate him!\\n This is the guy who did it!\\n Huh?\\n This guy\\u2026\\n These guys\\u2026slaughtered a lot of people without mercy\\u2026\\n Even innocent children.\\n If things continue like this, we\\u2019ll be sucked into the tributary\\u2026\\n What should we do?!\\n Ninja Art: Link and Slay.\\n What the heck?!\\n Wh-What is this?\\n Th-The ship\\u2019s been sliced in half\\u2026\\n Naruto!\\n Naruto!\\n You jerk!\\n It\\u2019s them!

He climbed onto the Mountainside Images…\\n And he vandalized and graffitied all over them!\\n Wait!\\n Ha ha…\\n Why should I?\\n Hey, Naruto!\\n How did you suddenly get here, lruka Sensei?\\n The question is what are you doing here when you should be in class now?\\n Now listen, Naruto.\\n You failed the last graduation test and the one before that.\\n This is no time to be goofing off, you fool!\\n We will have a re-test on the Transformation Jutsu!\\n Even those who already passed will take it!\\n Whaaaat?!\\n Sakura Haruno.

I-I will finish it no time!\\n Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!\\n Naruto.\\n Why did you vandalize those faces?\\n Don\\'t you know who the Hokage leaders are?\\n Of course, I do!\\n I know they earned the title Lord Hokage\\n because they were the best Ninja of their time, right?\\n Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero\\n who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox.\\n Then why did you do that?\\n Because I\\'ll become a Hokage myself.\\n And I\\'ll be the greatest Hokage of all time!\\n So that everyone will finally learn to accept me!\\n By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask.\\n You want another bowl?\\n Mmmm…No…\\n Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while?\\n This?\\n No no!\\n This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy.\\n Tomorrow, you will…\\n You\\'re so mean!\\n So that\\'s why you took off your goggles…\\n Humph... One more bowl please!\\n We are now about to begin the graduation test.\\n When your name is called, proceed to the next classroom.\\n The test is on the Clone Jutsu.\\n Oh no…\\n Of all the…!

That\\'s my son.\\n Congratulations for your graduation.\\n I\\'ll cook something good tonight!\\n Look at that one.\\n It\\'s that boy.

We need to talk later.\\n Yes, sir.\\n Iruka Sensei isn\\'t trying to be mean to you.\\n Then why only me?\\n He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart.\\n You both don\\'t have parents.\\n But I really wanted to graduate.\\n Heh... I guess I have no choice…\\n I\\'ll let you in on a big secret.\\n Secret?\\n Iruka.\\n What is it, Lord Hokage?\\n I know how you feel. But…\\n Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parents…like you.\\n Let me go!\\n My mom and dad are still out there fighting!\\n Wake up, Iruka Sensei!\\n What\\'s the matter?\\n Come to Lord Hokage\\'s immediately!\\n I heard that Naruto… stole the Scroll of Sealing.\\n The Scroll of Sealing?!\\n Let\\'s see…\\n The first Jutsu is… Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?\\n What?! Already a Jutsu I\\'m no good at?\\n Lord Hokage! We can\\'t forgive him!\\n This is not just a prank!\\n The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed!\\n Depending on its use…\\n It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village!\\n Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!\\n Yes, sir!\\n Where did you go…Naruto?\\n I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Naruto…\\n Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine!\\n Hey you, Naruto!\\n You found me..\\n And I\\'ve only learned one Jutsu.\\n He\\'s been practicing the Jutsu…\\n until he\\'s become this exhausted and dirty…?\\n Listen, listen! I\\'m gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!\\n You\\'re gonna let me graduate if I can do it!\\n Isn\\'t it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here?\\n Who told you that?\\n Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place…\\n Mizuki did?!\\n I\\'m impressed you found this place.\\n I see now…how it is.\\n Naruto, give me that scroll.\\n Wait, wait… What\\'s going on here?\\n Naruto! Never give him that scroll!\\n It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.\\n Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself!\\n W-Wha--?\\n Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll!\\n Huh?\\n What are you saying, Mizuki! Don\\'t let him fool you, Naruto!\\n I will tell you the truth.\\n Idiot! Don\\'t do that!\\n After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created.\\n A rule?\\n That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows.\\n Except me?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is it?\\n Stop it, Mizuki!\\n The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!\\n Huh?\\n You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,\\n who killed Iruka\\'s parents and destroyed our village!\\n Stop it!\\n Everyone has been deceiving you ever since.\\n Didn\\'t you find it strange?\\n Why everyone hated you so much?\\n No! No! No! No! No!\\n Naruto…\\n Nobody accepts you. That\\'s why Iruka hates you so much!\\n Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents.\\n Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened.\\n That\\'s why he keeps misbehaving.\\n It\\'s the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement.\\n He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting.\\n Die, Naruto!\\n Naruto! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGet down!\\n Why…?\\n Because you and I are the same.\\n After my parents died,\\n nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support.\\n I wasn\\'t a good student in school.\\n I was the class clown… because I wanted people to notice me.\\n I couldn\\'t get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things.\\n It was so hard.\\n Isn\\'t that right, Naruto?\\n You felt so lonely…right? And you suffered inside, right?\\n I\\'m sorry, Naruto….\\n If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn\\'t have suffered so much.\\n Don\\'t make me laugh!\\n Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents!\\n He\\'s just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back!\\n Naruto!\\n Narutoooooo!\\n He is not the type of kid who will change his mind.\\n He will take revenge against our village using that scroll!\\n Didn\\'t you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.\\n No… Naruto…isn\\'t…like that at all!\\n All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll.\\n I\\'ll take care of you later!\\n I-I won\\'t let you…\\n Well, well.\\n Mizuki has a big mouth!\\n Naruto feels worse than he\\'s ever felt.\\n He might unleash the power locked up inside him.\\n The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.\\n There\\'s a slight chance he might actually release\\n the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him!\\n If that happens…\\n I\\'ve found him!\\n Naruto!\\n Everything that Mizuki said was a lie!\\n Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll!\\n It can\\'t be…\\n Why is it, Naruto?\\n How…\\n did you know I wasn\\'t Iruka…?\\n Because I\\'m Iruka.\\n I see.\\n What\\'s in it for you to protect the one who killed your family?\\n I\\'m not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll!\\n You\\'re the idiot. Naruto is the same as me.\\n Same?\\n Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll.\\n There is no way that that monster…\\n that Fox Spirit, won\\'t take advantage of the power of that scroll!\\n You\\'re right…\\n I guess it was true all along!\\n See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all!\\n ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n But Naruto is different!\\n I know that he is an exceptional student.\\n He works very hard,\\n and he\\'s single-minded and clumsy at the same time.\\n No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering.\\n He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n He\\'s Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!\\n You are so gullible. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlruka!\\n I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind.\\n Die!\\n I guess this is the end for me…\\n Naruto?!\\n You surprised me there, freak.\\n If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I\\'ll kill you!\\n Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow!\\n Why don\\'t you try then? I\\'ll strike you back a thousand-fold!\\n Let\\'s see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu!\\n Naruto! You\\'ve…\\n Those aren\\'t just images but actual clones! That\\'s an advanced Ninjutsu!\\n What\\'s this…?\\n What\\'s the matter? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC\\'mon!\\n Weren\\'t you gonna get me with one blow? Here!\\n In that case… I\\'ll come to you.\\n I kinda got carried away. lruka Sensei, are you okay?\\n Yeah.\\n He\\'s really something.\\n Maybe it is true.\\n Maybe he will surpass all the Hokage leaders…\\n Naruto, come over here. I\\'d like to give you something.\\n Has anyone found Naruto yet?\\n No.\\n Darn, this is going to be bad…\\n There\\'s no need to worry anymore.\\n Lord Hokage!\\n He\\'ll be back soon.\\n Sensei, how much longer?\\n OK, you may open your eyes now.\\n Congratulations…on your graduation.\\n In celebration, we\\'ll have ramen tonight!\\n Iruka Sensei!\\n That hurts!\\n Naruto…\\n I was going to lecture to you...\\n that the road gets more difficult now that you\\'re a Ninja.\\n But I guess I\\'ll just wait to tell you that until we get to the ramen stand…\\n W-What do you want, you little shrimp? Quit following me!\\n You\\'re smaller than me and\\n you\\'re saying that you\\'re gonna become the Fifth Hokage?\\n I don\\'t care if you are the 3rd Hokage\\'s grandson or not.\\n It\\'s not that easy to be a Hokage!\\n If you want it that bad, you\\'re gonna have to beat me first!\\n Next episode:  \"My Name Is Konohamaru!\"\\n Watch my outstanding performance!\\n'"

C'mon! So hurry hurry!\\n Don't regret it later.\\n Say cheese!\\n My Name Is Konohamaru!\\n I couldn't decide on how to look.\\n It took me 3 hours to decide.\\n But as you can see, it's more like a work of art.\\n Doesn't it look great?\\n Take it over.\\n What?!\\n Take it over.\\n Stop saying that!\\n Transform!\\n Oh please, Lord Hokage\\u2026\\n The Sexy Jutsu\\u2026 That's quite a devious technique.\\n By the way Naruto, where's your headband?\\n I won't wear it until the orientation. lt might get scratched\\n Well, that's just fine.\\n But the Ninja Registration Form is a very important document\\n held in high regard by our village.\\n Why do you want to look like this?\\n Because!\\n Anyway, how should I know about all that stuff?\\n Old man! Get ready to fight!\\n I am going to be the Fifth Hokage!\\n Ouch!\\n If it's not one thing, it's another\\u2026.\\n Drat! Is this a trap?\\n Are you okay, Honorable Grandson?\\n May I just inform you that there aren't any traps here\\u2026\\n Huh? What's with this runt?\\n What?!\\n I know this kid\\u2026 He's that Nine-Tailed boy!\\n He's a good-for-nothing scoundrel!\\n You must have done this to me!\\n You tripped all by yourself, stupid!\\n Hey! Let go of him!\\n He is the Honorable Grandson of the Third Hokage!\\n He stopped as soon as he learned who I am\\u2026.\\n He's like my four-eyed teacher.\\n He's just like everyone else!\\n What's the matter?\\n Weren't you gonna hit me, huh?\\n Can't do it 'cuz I'm the Hokage's grandson, eh?\\n As if I care! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlmbecile!\\n This guy\\u2026\\n What?!\\n Good grief\\u2026\\n Listen to me.\\n You are the Honorable Grandson of the Third Hokage.\\n Even though that scoundrel hit you, you must not associate with his kind.\\n Nothing good will come of your tangling with him.\\n This is your distinguished teacher Ebisu,\\n and I am never wrong about these things!\\n Don't you want to become the Fifth Hokage?\\n Then allow me to teach you Ninjutsu,\\n so that your dream will become a reality.\\n That's right.\\n Stick with me and you will gain a shortcut towards becoming the Fifth Hokage.\\n Is that clear, Honorable Grandson?\\n He's gone!\\n It seems he's gone after Naruto.\\n Oh no!\\n This is terrible!\\n Honorable Grandson!\\n How did he become like this?\\n That was the 20th sneak attack today.\\n And now he's in the company of Naruto.

Boss! Boss!\\n I guess I have no choice.\\n Listen.\\n In order to become a skilled Ninja,\\n you must first learn to control your Chatora.\\n Chatora?\\n Yes, Chatora.\\n Boss, I think you mean Chakra.\\n Silence!\\n That's what real Ninjas call it!\\n Oh! I didn't know that!\\n Whew\\u2026 I'm glad he's a fool.\\n Listen. Chakra essentially means\\u2026\\n Basically, it is the energy needed in order to use Jutsu.\\n Huh?\\n In other words, fundamentally Ninja Arts combine the Chakra,\\n the physical energy accumulated from each cell in the body\\n with spiritual energy intensified through training and experience.\\n This combined energy is summoned with certain hand signs.\\n You made me think you knew all that,\\n when you were just reading from a scroll!\\n Much has been said about perfecting the Ninja techniques,\\n but it really boils down to just one thing.\\n And what is that?\\n Hard work and guts.\\n Hard work and guts?\\n That's right.\\n So be ready for the challenging tasks I will give you.\\n Yes, boss!\\n Good. Let's start right now. Transform for me.\\n Huh?\\n Let me see first how much you already know.\\n But what do I transform into?\\n OK... First, transform into that lady.\\n An easy task, boss.\\n Transform!\\n Well, do I look like her?\\n Uhm\\u2026 Well, the clothes do and\\u2026\\n And what's so similar about that?!\\n Honorable Grandson.\\n If you will transform into me, at least try to look a little cuter, OK?\\n She's scary!\\n Why am I the one who gets hit?\\n OK! Next, we'll do some research on sexiness!\\n Yes, boss!\\n I told you I don't allow reading here, Naruto!\\n This is the last test. Put all of your effort into it!\\n Yes, boss!\\n Transform!\\n Naruto! It's you again!\\n Why is it always me\\u2026?\\n Sorry.\\n Huh?\\n It's because I'm the Hokage's grandson.\\n Don't worry about it.\\n Huh?\\n You're now ready to perform the Sexy Jutsu!\\n You just need more practice.\\n Yes, boss!\\n OK, keep in mind\\u2026 the point is for \\\"boom boom boom\\\"!\\n Now do it!\\n Yes, boss! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTransform!\\n What do you think?\\n That won't do!\\n More slender.\\n Yes, boss!\\n Is this okay?\\n Not yet. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMore attractive.\\n Yes, boss!\\n How about now?\\n That Naruto\\u2026 What is he teaching the Honorable Grandson\\u2026?\\n Where the hell could they be\\u2026?\\n I am a distinguished teacher training potential Hokage.\\n All those who interfere will be eliminated.\\n You know I've been wondering\\u2026\\n You seem obsessed with beating your Grandpa Hokage.\\n My name is Konohamaru.\\n It was Grandpa who gave me that name.\\n He named me after our village.\\n It should be easy for everyone here to remember.\\n But nobody ever calls me by that name.\\n When they see me, all they see is the grandson of Lord Hokage.\\n No one sees me for who I really am.\\n I can't stand it anymore.\\n That's why\\u2026\\n That's why I want the title of Lord Hokage now.\\n Idiot\\u2026Who do you think will accept you, huh?\\n Huh?\\n You won't win the title that easily, you know.\\n What?!\\n It's not that simple.\\n If you're really serious about gaining the title of Lord Hokage\\u2026\\n What?\\n You'll have to beat me first!\\n Lord Hokage! I've been looking for you.\\n Iruka.\\n Did Naruto re-submit his Ninja Registration Form?\\n Yes.\\n When I lectured to him the other night at the ramen stand,\\n he said he will make everyone accept him now that he's a Ninja.\\n He's been happy since then.\\n It might not be easy for Naruto to realize that dream.\\n Huh?\\n As you well know,\\n only the villagers who fought the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit 12 years ago\\n know that the monster is sealed inside Naruto.\\n I ruled that no one shall speak about that incident.\\n I have severely punished those who have broken this rule.\\n Now our children know nothing about it.\\n That is the only positive development for Naruto.\\n Before the Fourth Hokage trapped the monster and died,\\n his last wish was for the villagers to regard Naruto as a hero.\\n A hero?\\n The Fourth Hokage sealed the monster into the navel of a newborn baby\\n whose umbilical cord had just been cut.\\n As the receptacle for the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,\\n Naruto saved the village.\\n Unfortunately, the other villagers don't see him like that.\\n Some even say that Naruto is the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit himself.\\n Little by little, that attitude has been passed down to their own children.\\n Iruka. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDo you know?\\n What, sir?\\n When someone is hated and people refuse to accept his existence,\\n he sees it in the eyes of the people around him.\\n I have found you!\\n Huh?\\n That Demon Fox!!\\n That cold look! lt's always like that!\\n Honorable Grandson, we have to go now.\\n No way!\\n I want to beat Grandpa right now so I can win the title of Lord Hokage!\\n Don't get in my way!\\n A Hokage must first know about virtue, honor, etiquette, wisdom, loyalty, faith,\\n judgment, obedience and all that.\\n He must be skilled at more than thousand techniques\\u2026\\n And then...\\n Transform!\\n Take this! Sexy Jutsu!\\n What? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlt didn't work!\\n What kind of a disgraceful spell is that?!\\n I am a gentleman!\\n Such vulgar attacks will never work on me!\\n Honorable Grandson! That rascal will only make you an imbecile!\\n Stick with me and...\\n you will gain a shortcut towards becoming the Fifth Hokage.\\n C'mon, let's go!\\n No way!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu\\n Wow! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFantastic!\\n Ha! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat's nothing.\\n I am a distinguished teacher.\\n I am not as weak as Mizuki.\\n Boss\\u2026\\n Transform!\\n Transform!\\n Oh, Master Ebisu\\u2026\\n I call it \\\"the Harem Jutsu\\\"!\\n He combined the Multiple Clones with his own Sexy Jutsu.\\n That's another devious attack.\\n I probably won't even survive that one.\\n I can't even beat that four-eyed teacher of mine!\\n I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly! I want to be recognized by everybody!\\n But I keep failing.\\n You think it's that easy?\\n Huh?\\n It's given only to the greatest Ninja in the village.\\n Everybody must learn to believe in you.\\n I've been through a lot already.\\n It's been one struggle after another.\\n But after all that, I found someone who accepts me.\\n I had to go through a lot... Just for one person.\\n You had better push yourself.\\n For what?\\n The path of getting the title, Lord Hokage, is a brutal one.\\n There's no such thing as a shortcut.\\n If you're really serious about attaining the title of Lord Hokage\\n You'll have to beat me first.\\n Who do you think you are, lecturing me like that?\\n I won't be your apprentice anymore.\\n From now on, you're my rival.\\n Unfortunately for you, tomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy.\\n Still, I'll consider you an equal someday when we fight for the title of Lord Hokage.\\n Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru.\\n You still have a long way to go to become a real Ninja.\\n Aaah! Why do I have to be in the same group with Sasuke?\\n The guy I hate the most?\\n Sakura keeps saying  \\\"Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!\\\"\\n and doesn't even pay attention to me!\\n It makes me so mad! I got it! I'm going to pull one on him!\\n I'm not gonna let him be so cool in front of Sakura!\\n Next Episode:  \\\"Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?\\\"\\n Watch my outstanding performance!\\n\",\n          \"A long time ago, a powerful demon fox appeared with nine tails.\\n With its powerful tails,\\n it could smash mountains and create tidal waves.\\n A band of Ninjas rose to defend their village from attack.\\n We have to wait until the Fourth Hokage gets here!\\n We can't let it get any closer to our village!\\n One great Ninja was able to imprison the monster,\\n but died in the process.\\n This Ninja was known as\\u2026 the Fourth Hokage.\\n Naruto!\\n Why did you do such a thing?!\\n You're really gonna get it this time!\\n I don't care!\\n You know your problem?\\n You can't do the things I do!\\n Only I can do this!\\n I'm better than all of you!

I-I will finish it no time!\\n Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!\\n Naruto.\\n Why did you vandalize those faces?\\n Don't you know who the Hokage leaders are?\\n Of course, I do!\\n I know they earned the title Lord Hokage\\n because they were the best Ninja of their time, right?\\n Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero\\n who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox.\\n Then why did you do that?\\n Because I'll become a Hokage myself.\\n And I'll be the greatest Hokage of all time!\\n So that everyone will finally learn to accept me!\\n By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask.\\n You want another bowl?\\n Mmmm\\u2026No\\u2026\\n Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while?\\n This?\\n No no!\\n This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy.\\n Tomorrow, you will\\u2026\\n You're so mean!\\n So that's why you took off your goggles\\u2026\\n Humph...

All the others created three or more clones.\\n Naruto created just one.\\n And it's practically useless. I can't give him a passing mark.\\n I 'm a Ninja now!\\n You did well. That's my son.\\n Congratulations for your graduation.\\n I'll cook something good tonight!\\n Look at that one.\\n It's that boy.

We need to talk later.\\n Yes, sir.\\n Iruka Sensei isn't trying to be mean to you.\\n Then why only me?\\n He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart.\\n You both don't have parents.\\n But I really wanted to graduate.\\n Heh... I guess I have no choice\\u2026\\n I'll let you in on a big secret.\\n Secret?\\n Iruka.\\n What is it, Lord Hokage?\\n I know how you feel. But\\u2026\\n Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parents\\u2026like you.\\n Let me go!\\n My mom and dad are still out there fighting!\\n Wake up, Iruka Sensei!\\n What's the matter?\\n Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!\\n I heard that Naruto\\u2026 stole the Scroll of Sealing.\\n The Scroll of Sealing?!\\n Let's see\\u2026\\n The first Jutsu is\\u2026 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?\\n What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?\\n Lord Hokage! We can't forgive him!\\n This is not just a prank!\\n The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed!\\n Depending on its use\\u2026\\n It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village!\\n Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!\\n Yes, sir!\\n Where did you go\\u2026Naruto?\\n I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Naruto\\u2026\\n Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine!\\n Hey you, Naruto!\\n You found me..\\n And I've only learned one Jutsu.\\n He's been practicing the Jutsu\\u2026\\n until he's become this exhausted and dirty\\u2026?\\n Listen, listen! I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!\\n You're gonna let me graduate if I can do it!\\n Isn't it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here?\\n Who told you that?\\n Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place\\u2026\\n Mizuki did?!\\n I'm impressed you found this place.\\n I see now\\u2026how it is.\\n Naruto, give me that scroll.\\n Wait, wait\\u2026 What's going on here?\\n Naruto! Never give him that scroll!\\n It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.\\n Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself!\\n W-Wha--?\\n Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll!\\n Huh?\\n What are you saying, Mizuki! Don't let him fool you, Naruto!\\n I will tell you the truth.\\n Idiot! Don't do that!\\n After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created.\\n A rule?\\n That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows.\\n Except me?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is it?\\n Stop it, Mizuki!\\n The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!\\n Huh?\\n You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,\\n who killed Iruka's parents and destroyed our village!\\n Stop it!\\n Everyone has been deceiving you ever since.\\n Didn't you find it strange?\\n Why everyone hated you so much?\\n No! No! No! No! No!\\n Naruto\\u2026\\n Nobody accepts you. That's why Iruka hates you so much!\\n Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents.\\n Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened.\\n That's why he keeps misbehaving.\\n It's the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement.\\n He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting.\\n Die, Naruto!\\n Naruto! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGet down!\\n Why\\u2026?\\n Because you and I are the same.\\n After my parents died,\\n nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support.\\n I wasn't a good student in school.\\n I was the class clown\\u2026 because I wanted people to notice me.\\n I couldn't get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things.\\n It was so hard.\\n Isn't that right, Naruto?\\n You felt so lonely\\u2026right? And you suffered inside, right?\\n I'm sorry, Naruto\\u2026.\\n If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.\\n Don't make me laugh!\\n Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents!\\n He's just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back!\\n Naruto!\\n Narutoooooo!\\n He is not the type of kid who will change his mind.\\n He will take revenge against our village using that scroll!\\n Didn't you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.\\n No\\u2026 Naruto\\u2026isn't\\u2026like that at all!\\n All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll.\\n I'll take care of you later!\\n I-I won't let you\\u2026\\n Well, well.\\n Mizuki has a big mouth!\\n Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.\\n He might unleash the power locked up inside him.\\n The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.\\n There's a slight chance he might actually release\\n the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him!\\n If that happens\\u2026\\n I've found him!\\n Naruto!\\n Everything that Mizuki said was a lie!\\n Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll!\\n It can't be\\u2026\\n Why is it, Naruto?\\n How\\u2026\\n did you know I wasn't Iruka\\u2026?\\n Because I'm Iruka.\\n I see.\\n What's in it for you to protect the one who killed your family?\\n I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll!\\n You're the idiot. Naruto is the same as me.\\n Same?\\n Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll.\\n There is no way that that monster\\u2026\\n that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage of the power of that scroll!\\n You're right\\u2026\\n I guess it was true all along!\\n See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all!\\n ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n But Naruto is different!\\n I know that he is an exceptional student.\\n He works very hard,\\n and he's single-minded and clumsy at the same time.\\n No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering.\\n He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n He's Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!\\n You are so gullible. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlruka!\\n I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind.\\n Die!\\n I guess this is the end for me\\u2026\\n Naruto?!\\n You surprised me there, freak.\\n If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you!\\n Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow!\\n Why don't you try then? I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!\\n Let's see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu!\\n Naruto! You've\\u2026\\n Those aren't just images but actual clones! That's an advanced Ninjutsu!\\n What's this\\u2026?\\n What's the matter? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC'mon!\\n Weren't you gonna get me with one blow? Here!\\n In that case\\u2026 I'll come to you.\\n I kinda got carried away. lruka Sensei, are you okay?\\n Yeah.\\n He's really something.\\n Maybe it is true.\\n Maybe he will surpass all the Hokage leaders\\u2026\\n Naruto, come over here. I'd like to give you something.\\n Has anyone found Naruto yet?\\n No.\\n Darn, this is going to be bad\\u2026\\n There's no need to worry anymore.\\n Lord Hokage!\\n He'll be back soon.\\n Sensei, how much longer?\\n OK, you may open your eyes now.\\n Congratulations\\u2026on your graduation.\\n In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight!\\n Iruka Sensei!\\n That hurts!\\n Naruto\\u2026\\n I was going to lecture to you...\\n that the road gets more difficult now that you're a Ninja.\\n But I guess I'll just wait to tell you that until we get to the ramen stand\\u2026\\n W-What do you want, you little shrimp? Quit following me!\\n You're smaller than me and\\n you're saying that you're gonna become the Fifth Hokage?\\n I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage's grandson or not.\\n It's not that easy to be a Hokage!\\n If you want it that bad, you're gonna have to beat me first!\\n Next episode:  \\\"My Name Is Konohamaru!\\\"\\n Watch my outstanding performance!\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Chakra essentially means\\u2026\\n Basically, it is the energy needed in order to use Jutsu.\\n Huh?\\n In other words, fundamentally Ninja Arts combine the Chakra,\\n the physical energy accumulated from each cell in the body\\n with spiritual energy intensified through training and experience.\\n This combined energy is summoned with certain hand signs.\\n You made me think you knew all that,\\n when you were just reading from a scroll!\\n Much has been said about perfecting the Ninja techniques,\\n but it really boils down to just one thing.\\n And what is that?\\n Hard work and guts.\\n Hard work and guts?\\n That's right.\\n So be ready for the challenging tasks I will give you.\\n Yes, boss!\\n Good. Let's start right now. Transform for me.\\n Huh?\\n Let me see first how much you already know.\\n But what do I transform into?\\n OK... First, transform into that lady.\\n An easy task, boss.\\n Transform!\\n Well, do I look like her?\\n Uhm\\u2026 Well, the clothes do and\\u2026\\n And what's so similar about that?!\\n Honorable Grandson.\\n If you will transform into me, at least try to look a little cuter, OK?\\n She's scary!\\n Why am I the one who gets hit?\\n OK! Next, we'll do some research on sexiness!\\n Yes, boss!\\n I told you I don't allow reading here, Naruto!\\n This is the last test. Put all of your effort into it!\\n Yes, boss!\\n Transform!\\n Naruto! It's you again!\\n Why is it always me\\u2026?\\n Sorry.\\n Huh?\\n It's because I'm the Hokage's grandson.\\n Don't worry about it.\\n Huh?\\n You're now ready to perform the Sexy Jutsu!\\n You just need more practice.\\n Yes, boss!\\n OK, keep in mind\\u2026 the point is for \\\"boom boom boom\\\"!\\n Now do it!\\n Yes, boss! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTransform!\\n What do you think?\\n That won't do!\\n More slender.\\n Yes, boss!\\n Is this okay?\\n Not yet. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMore attractive.\\n Yes, boss!\\n How about now?\\n That Naruto\\u2026 What is he teaching the Honorable Grandson\\u2026?\\n Where the hell could they be\\u2026?\\n I am a distinguished teacher training potential Hokage.\\n All those who interfere will be eliminated.\\n You know I've been wondering\\u2026\\n You seem obsessed with beating your Grandpa Hokage.\\n My name is Konohamaru.\\n It was Grandpa who gave me that name.\\n He named me after our village.\\n It should be easy for everyone here to remember.\\n But nobody ever calls me by that name.\\n When they see me, all they see is the grandson of Lord Hokage.\\n No one sees me for who I really am.\\n I can't stand it anymore.\\n That's why\\u2026\\n That's why I want the title of Lord Hokage now.\\n Idiot\\u2026Who do you think will accept you, huh?\\n Huh?\\n You won't win the title that easily, you know.\\n What?!\\n It's not that simple.\\n If you're really serious about gaining the title of Lord Hokage\\u2026\\n What?\\n You'll have to beat me first!\\n Lord Hokage! I've been looking for you.\\n Iruka.\\n Did Naruto re-submit his Ninja Registration Form?\\n Yes.\\n When I lectured to him the other night at the ramen stand,\\n he said he will make everyone accept him now that he's a Ninja.\\n He's been happy since then.\\n It might not be easy for Naruto to realize that dream.\\n Huh?\\n As you well know,\\n only the villagers who fought the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit 12 years ago\\n know that the monster is sealed inside Naruto.\\n I ruled that no one shall speak about that incident.\\n I have severely punished those who have broken this rule.\\n Now our children know nothing about it.\\n That is the only positive development for Naruto.\\n Before the Fourth Hokage trapped the monster and died,\\n his last wish was for the villagers to regard Naruto as a hero.\\n A hero?\\n The Fourth Hokage sealed the monster into the navel of a newborn baby\\n whose umbilical cord had just been cut.\\n As the receptacle for the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,\\n Naruto saved the village.\\n Unfortunately, the other villagers don't see him like that.\\n Some even say that Naruto is the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit himself.\\n Little by little, that attitude has been passed down to their own children.\\n Iruka. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDo you know?\\n What, sir?\\n When someone is hated and people refuse to accept his existence,\\n he sees it in the eyes of the people around him.\\n I have found you!\\n Huh?\\n That Demon Fox!!\\n That cold look! lt's always like that!\\n Honorable Grandson, we have to go now.\\n No way!\\n I want to beat Grandpa right now so I can win the title of Lord Hokage!\\n Don't get in my way!\\n A Hokage must first know about virtue, honor, etiquette, wisdom, loyalty, faith,\\n judgment, obedience and all that.\\n He must be skilled at more than thousand techniques\\u2026\\n And then...\\n Transform!\\n Take this! Sexy Jutsu!\\n What? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlt didn't work!\\n What kind of a disgraceful spell is that?!\\n I am a gentleman!\\n Such vulgar attacks will never work on me!\\n Honorable Grandson! That rascal will only make you an imbecile!\\n Stick with me and...\\n you will gain a shortcut towards becoming the Fifth Hokage.\\n C'mon, let's go!\\n No way!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu\\n Wow! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFantastic!\\n Ha! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat's nothing.\\n I am a distinguished teacher.\\n I am not as weak as Mizuki.\\n Boss\\u2026\\n Transform!\\n Transform!\\n Oh, Master Ebisu\\u2026\\n I call it \\\"the Harem Jutsu\\\"!\\n He combined the Multiple Clones with his own Sexy Jutsu.\\n That's another devious attack.\\n I probably won't even survive that one.\\n I can't even beat that four-eyed teacher of mine!\\n I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly! I want to be recognized by everybody!\\n But I keep failing.\\n You think it's that easy?\\n Huh?\\n It's given only to the greatest Ninja in the village.\\n Everybody must learn to believe in you.\\n I've been through a lot already.\\n It's been one struggle after another.\\n But after all that, I found someone who accepts me.\\n I had to go through a lot... Just for one person.\\n You had better push yourself.\\n For what?\\n The path of getting the title, Lord Hokage, is a brutal one.\\n There's no such thing as a shortcut.\\n If you're really serious about attaining the title of Lord Hokage\\n You'll have to beat me first.\\n Who do you think you are, lecturing me like that?\\n I won't be your apprentice anymore.\\n From now on, you're my rival.\\n Unfortunately for you, tomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy.\\n Still, I'll consider you an equal someday when we fight for the title of Lord Hokage.\\n Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru.\\n You still have a long way to go to become a real Ninja.\\n Aaah! Why do I have to be in the same group with Sasuke?\\n The guy I hate the most?\\n Sakura keeps saying  \\\"Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!\\\"\\n and doesn't even pay attention to me!\\n It makes me so mad! I got it! I'm going to pull one on him!\\n I'm not gonna let him be so cool in front of Sakura!\\n Next Episode:  \\\"Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?\\\"\\n Watch my outstanding performance!\\n\",\n          \"A long time ago, a powerful demon fox appeared with nine tails.\\n With its powerful tails,\\n it could smash mountains and create tidal waves.\\n A band of Ninjas rose to defend their village from attack.\\n We have to wait until the Fourth Hokage gets here!\\n We can't let it get any closer to our village!\\n One great Ninja was able to imprison the monster,\\n but died in the process.\\n This Ninja was known as\\u2026 the Fourth Hokage.\\n Naruto!\\n Why did you do such a thing?!\\n You're really gonna get it this time!\\n I don't care!\\n You know your problem?\\n You can't do the things I do!\\n Only I can do this!\\n I'm better than all of you! Believe it!\\n There's a problem, sir!\\n Lord Hokage!\\n What is it?\\n Did that Naruto do something again?\\n Yes. He climbed onto the Mountainside Images\\u2026\\n And he vandalized and graffitied all over them!\\n Wait!\\n Ha ha\\u2026\\n Why should I?\\n Hey, Naruto!\\n How did you suddenly get here, lruka Sensei?\\n The question is what are you doing here when you should be in class now?\\n Now listen, Naruto.\\n You failed the last graduation test and the one before that.\\n This is no time to be goofing off, you fool!\\n We will have a re-test on the Transformation Jutsu!\\n Even those who already passed will take it!\\n Whaaaat?!\\n Sakura Haruno. Here I go\\u2026\\n Transform!\\n OK!\\n I did it!\\n Cha!\\n Did you see that, Sasuke?\\n Next, Sasuke Uchiha.\\n Yes.\\n O-OK.\\n Next, Naruto Uzumaki.\\n This is a real pain.\\n And it's all your fault.\\n Like I care!!\\n OK\\u2026\\n Good luck, Naruto\\u2026\\n Transform!\\n How was it?\\n I call it the \\\"Sexy Jutsu\\\"!\\n You fool! Stop making idiotic spells!\\n Darn\\u2026\\n Darn\\u2026\\n I won't let you go home unless you clean that all up.\\n I don't care\\u2026\\n There's nobody home anyway.\\n Naruto...\\n What is it this time?\\n What I meant was\\u2026\\n If you clean up all that mess, I'll buy you ramen tonight.\\n Huh?!\\n Yes! I-I will finish it no time!\\n Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!\\n Naruto.\\n Why did you vandalize those faces?\\n Don't you know who the Hokage leaders are?\\n Of course, I do!\\n I know they earned the title Lord Hokage\\n because they were the best Ninja of their time, right?\\n Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero\\n who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox.\\n Then why did you do that?\\n Because I'll become a Hokage myself.\\n And I'll be the greatest Hokage of all time!\\n So that everyone will finally learn to accept me!\\n By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask.\\n You want another bowl?\\n Mmmm\\u2026No\\u2026\\n Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while?\\n This?\\n No no!\\n This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy.\\n Tomorrow, you will\\u2026\\n You're so mean!\\n So that's why you took off your goggles\\u2026\\n Humph... One more bowl please!\\n We are now about to begin the graduation test.\\n When your name is called, proceed to the next classroom.\\n The test is on the Clone Jutsu.\\n Oh no\\u2026\\n Of all the\\u2026! That is my weakest Jutsu!\\n But still\\u2026 I will do it no matter what!\\n Clone Jutsu!\\n Disqualified!\\n Iruka Sensei.\\n His physical coordination and stamina are excellent.\\n And he managed to come up with something.\\n Isn't that enough for him to pass?\\n Mizuki Sensei... All the others created three or more clones.\\n Naruto created just one.\\n And it's practically useless. I can't give him a passing mark.\\n I 'm a Ninja now!\\n You did well. That's my son.\\n Congratulations for your graduation.\\n I'll cook something good tonight!\\n Look at that one.\\n It's that boy. I hear he's the only one who failed.\\n Serves him right.\\n Imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja.\\n Isn't that the boy who is actually\\u2026\\n Hey! We're not supposed to talk about that.\\n Iruka. We need to talk later.\\n Yes, sir.\\n Iruka Sensei isn't trying to be mean to you.\\n Then why only me?\\n He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart.\\n You both don't have parents.\\n But I really wanted to graduate.\\n Heh... I guess I have no choice\\u2026\\n I'll let you in on a big secret.\\n Secret?\\n Iruka.\\n What is it, Lord Hokage?\\n I know how you feel. But\\u2026\\n Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parents\\u2026like you.\\n Let me go!\\n My mom and dad are still out there fighting!\\n Wake up, Iruka Sensei!\\n What's the matter?\\n Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!\\n I heard that Naruto\\u2026 stole the Scroll of Sealing.\\n The Scroll of Sealing?!\\n Let's see\\u2026\\n The first Jutsu is\\u2026 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?\\n What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?\\n Lord Hokage! We can't forgive him!\\n This is not just a prank!\\n The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed!\\n Depending on its use\\u2026\\n It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village!\\n Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!\\n Yes, sir!\\n Where did you go\\u2026Naruto?\\n I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Naruto\\u2026\\n Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine!\\n Hey you, Naruto!\\n You found me..\\n And I've only learned one Jutsu.\\n He's been practicing the Jutsu\\u2026\\n until he's become this exhausted and dirty\\u2026?\\n Listen, listen! I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!\\n You're gonna let me graduate if I can do it!\\n Isn't it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here?\\n Who told you that?\\n Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place\\u2026\\n Mizuki did?!\\n I'm impressed you found this place.\\n I see now\\u2026how it is.\\n Naruto, give me that scroll.\\n Wait, wait\\u2026 What's going on here?\\n Naruto! Never give him that scroll!\\n It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.\\n Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself!\\n W-Wha--?\\n Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll!\\n Huh?\\n What are you saying, Mizuki! Don't let him fool you, Naruto!\\n I will tell you the truth.\\n Idiot! Don't do that!\\n After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created.\\n A rule?\\n That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows.\\n Except me?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is it?\\n Stop it, Mizuki!\\n The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!\\n Huh?\\n You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,\\n who killed Iruka's parents and destroyed our village!\\n Stop it!\\n Everyone has been deceiving you ever since.\\n Didn't you find it strange?\\n Why everyone hated you so much?\\n No! No! No! No! No!\\n Naruto\\u2026\\n Nobody accepts you. That's why Iruka hates you so much!\\n Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents.\\n Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened.\\n That's why he keeps misbehaving.\\n It's the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement.\\n He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting.\\n Die, Naruto!\\n Naruto! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGet down!\\n Why\\u2026?\\n Because you and I are the same.\\n After my parents died,\\n nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support.\\n I wasn't a good student in school.\\n I was the class clown\\u2026 because I wanted people to notice me.\\n I couldn't get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things.\\n It was so hard.\\n Isn't that right, Naruto?\\n You felt so lonely\\u2026right? And you suffered inside, right?\\n I'm sorry, Naruto\\u2026.\\n If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.\\n Don't make me laugh!\\n Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents!\\n He's just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back!\\n Naruto!\\n Narutoooooo!\\n He is not the type of kid who will change his mind.\\n He will take revenge against our village using that scroll!\\n Didn't you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.\\n No\\u2026 Naruto\\u2026isn't\\u2026like that at all!\\n All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll.\\n I'll take care of you later!\\n I-I won't let you\\u2026\\n Well, well.\\n Mizuki has a big mouth!\\n Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.\\n He might unleash the power locked up inside him.\\n The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.\\n There's a slight chance he might actually release\\n the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him!\\n If that happens\\u2026\\n I've found him!\\n Naruto!\\n Everything that Mizuki said was a lie!\\n Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll!\\n It can't be\\u2026\\n Why is it, Naruto?\\n How\\u2026\\n did you know I wasn't Iruka\\u2026?\\n Because I'm Iruka.\\n I see.\\n What's in it for you to protect the one who killed your family?\\n I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll!\\n You're the idiot. Naruto is the same as me.\\n Same?\\n Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll.\\n There is no way that that monster\\u2026\\n that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage of the power of that scroll!\\n You're right\\u2026\\n I guess it was true all along!\\n See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all!\\n ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n But Naruto is different!\\n I know that he is an exceptional student.\\n He works very hard,\\n and he's single-minded and clumsy at the same time.\\n No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering.\\n He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n He's Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!\\n You are so gullible. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlruka!\\n I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind.\\n Die!\\n I guess this is the end for me\\u2026\\n Naruto?!\\n You surprised me there, freak.\\n If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you!\\n Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow!\\n Why don't you try then? I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!\\n Let's see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu!\\n Naruto! You've\\u2026\\n Those aren't just images but actual clones! That's an advanced Ninjutsu!\\n What's this\\u2026?\\n What's the matter? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC'mon!\\n Weren't you gonna get me with one blow? Here!\\n In that case\\u2026 I'll come to you.\\n I kinda got carried away. lruka Sensei, are you okay?\\n Yeah.\\n He's really something.\\n Maybe it is true.\\n Maybe he will surpass all the Hokage leaders\\u2026\\n Naruto, come over here. I'd like to give you something.\\n Has anyone found Naruto yet?\\n No.\\n Darn, this is going to be bad\\u2026\\n There's no need to worry anymore.\\n Lord Hokage!\\n He'll be back soon.\\n Sensei, how much longer?\\n OK, you may open your eyes now.\\n Congratulations\\u2026on your graduation.\\n In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight!\\n Iruka Sensei!\\n That hurts!\\n Naruto\\u2026\\n I was going to lecture to you...\\n that the road gets more difficult now that you're a Ninja.\\n But I guess I'll just wait to tell you that until we get to the ramen stand\\u2026\\n W-What do you want, you little shrimp? Quit following me!\\n You're smaller than me and\\n you're saying that you're gonna become the Fifth Hokage?\\n I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage's grandson or not.\\n It's not that easy to be a Hokage!\\n If you want it that bad, you're gonna have to beat me first!\\n Next episode:  \\\"My Name Is Konohamaru!\\\"\\n Watch my outstanding performance!\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"dialogue\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0014585970598407652,\n        \"min\": 0.9585433006286621,\n        \"max\": 0.9606060683727264,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9606060683727264,\n          0.9585433006286621\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"betrayal\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.25651348954540626,\n        \"min\": 0.42994377948343754,\n        \"max\": 0.7927086353302002,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.42994377948343754,\n          0.7927086353302002\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"battle\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.050603624201317046,\n        \"min\": 0.6848458498716354,\n        \"max\": 0.7564101815223694,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.6848458498716354,\n          0.7564101815223694\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sacrifice\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.07759009325216058,\n        \"min\": 0.5707037150859833,\n        \"max\": 0.6804326772689819,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5707037150859833,\n          0.6804326772689819\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"self development\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.22298553062646534,\n        \"min\": 0.48281005024909973,\n        \"max\": 0.7981592118740082,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.48281005024909973,\n          0.7981592118740082\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"hope\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.03332971002171328,\n        \"min\": 0.15453363489359617,\n        \"max\": 0.20166896283626556,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.15453363489359617,\n          0.20166896283626556\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"friendship\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.01864464625555595,\n        \"min\": 0.04626081511378288,\n        \"max\": 0.07262832671403885,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.04626081511378288,\n          0.07262832671403885\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"love\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.09837266819757061,\n        \"min\": 0.03414125647395849,\n        \"max\": 0.1732612180057913,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.1732612180057913,\n          0.03414125647395849\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Boss! Boss!\\n I guess I have no choice.\\n Listen.\\n In order to become a skilled Ninja,\\n you must first learn to control your Chatora.\\n Chatora?\\n Yes, Chatora.\\n Boss, I think you mean Chakra.\\n Silence!\\n That's what real Ninjas call it!\\n Oh! I didn't know that!\\n Whew\\u2026 I'm glad he's a fool.\\n Listen. Chakra essentially means\\u2026\\n Basically, it is the energy needed in order to use Jutsu.\\n Huh?\\n In other words, fundamentally Ninja Arts combine the Chakra,\\n the physical energy accumulated from each cell in the body\\n with spiritual energy intensified through training and experience.\\n This combined energy is summoned with certain hand signs.\\n You made me think you knew all that,\\n when you were just reading from a scroll!\\n Much has been said about perfecting the Ninja techniques,\\n but it really boils down to just one thing.\\n And what is that?\\n Hard work and guts.\\n Hard work and guts?\\n That's right.\\n So be ready for the challenging tasks I will give you.\\n Yes, boss!\\n Good. Let's start right now. Transform for me.\\n Huh?\\n Let me see first how much you already know.\\n But what do I transform into?\\n OK...

Next, we'll do some research on sexiness!\\n Yes, boss!\\n I told you I don't allow reading here, Naruto!\\n This is the last test. Put all of your effort into it!\\n Yes, boss!\\n Transform!\\n Naruto! It's you again!\\n Why is it always me\\u2026?\\n Sorry.\\n Huh?\\n It's because I'm the Hokage's grandson.\\n Don't worry about it.\\n Huh?\\n You're now ready to perform the Sexy Jutsu!\\n You just need more practice.\\n Yes, boss!\\n OK, keep in mind\\u2026 the point is for \\\"boom boom boom\\\"!\\n Now do it!\\n Yes, boss! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTransform!\\n What do you think?\\n That won't do!\\n More slender.\\n Yes, boss!\\n Is this okay?\\n Not yet. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMore attractive.\\n Yes, boss!\\n How about now?\\n That Naruto\\u2026 What is he teaching the Honorable Grandson\\u2026?\\n Where the hell could they be\\u2026?\\n I am a distinguished teacher training potential Hokage.\\n All those who interfere will be eliminated.\\n You know I've been wondering\\u2026\\n You seem obsessed with beating your Grandpa Hokage.\\n My name is Konohamaru.\\n It was Grandpa who gave me that name.\\n He named me after our village.\\n It should be easy for everyone here to remember.\\n But nobody ever calls me by that name.\\n When they see me, all they see is the grandson of Lord Hokage.\\n No one sees me for who I really am.\\n I can't stand it anymore.\\n That's why\\u2026\\n That's why I want the title of Lord Hokage now.\\n Idiot\\u2026Who do you think will accept you, huh?\\n Huh?\\n You won't win the title that easily, you know.\\n What?!\\n It's not that simple.\\n If you're really serious about gaining the title of Lord Hokage\\u2026\\n What?\\n You'll have to beat me first!\\n Lord Hokage! I've been looking for you.\\n Iruka.\\n Did Naruto re-submit his Ninja Registration Form?\\n Yes.\\n When I lectured to him the other night at the ramen stand,\\n he said he will make everyone accept him now that he's a Ninja.\\n He's been happy since then.\\n It might not be easy for Naruto to realize that dream.\\n Huh?\\n As you well know,\\n only the villagers who fought the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit 12 years ago\\n know that the monster is sealed inside Naruto.\\n I ruled that no one shall speak about that incident.\\n I have severely punished those who have broken this rule.\\n Now our children know nothing about it.\\n That is the only positive development for Naruto.\\n Before the Fourth Hokage trapped the monster and died,\\n his last wish was for the villagers to regard Naruto as a hero.\\n A hero?\\n The Fourth Hokage sealed the monster into the navel of a newborn baby\\n whose umbilical cord had just been cut.\\n As the receptacle for the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,\\n Naruto saved the village.\\n Unfortunately, the other villagers don't see him like that.\\n Some even say that Naruto is the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit himself.\\n Little by little, that attitude has been passed down to their own children.\\n Iruka. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDo you know?\\n What, sir?\\n When someone is hated and people refuse to accept his existence,\\n he sees it in the eyes of the people around him.\\n I have found you!\\n Huh?\\n That Demon Fox!!\\n That cold look! lt's always like that!\\n Honorable Grandson, we have to go now.\\n No way!\\n I want to beat Grandpa right now so I can win the title of Lord Hokage!\\n Don't get in my way!\\n A Hokage must first know about virtue, honor, etiquette, wisdom, loyalty, faith,\\n judgment, obedience and all that.\\n He must be skilled at more than thousand techniques\\u2026\\n And then...\\n Transform!\\n Take this! Sexy Jutsu!\\n What? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlt didn't work!\\n What kind of a disgraceful spell is that?!\\n I am a gentleman!\\n Such vulgar attacks will never work on me!\\n Honorable Grandson! That rascal will only make you an imbecile!\\n Stick with me and...\\n you will gain a shortcut towards becoming the Fifth Hokage.\\n C'mon, let's go!\\n No way!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu\\n Wow! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFantastic!\\n Ha! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat's nothing.\\n I am a distinguished teacher.\\n I am not as weak as Mizuki.\\n Boss\\u2026\\n Transform!\\n Transform!\\n Oh, Master Ebisu\\u2026\\n I call it \\\"the Harem Jutsu\\\"!\\n He combined the Multiple Clones with his own Sexy Jutsu.\\n That's another devious attack.\\n I probably won't even survive that one.\\n I can't even beat that four-eyed teacher of mine!\\n I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly! I want to be recognized by everybody!\\n But I keep failing.\\n You think it's that easy?\\n Huh?\\n It's given only to the greatest Ninja in the village.\\n Everybody must learn to believe in you.\\n I've been through a lot already.\\n It's been one struggle after another.\\n But after all that, I found someone who accepts me.\\n I had to go through a lot... Just for one person.\\n You had better push yourself.\\n For what?\\n The path of getting the title, Lord Hokage, is a brutal one.\\n There's no such thing as a shortcut.\\n If you're really serious about attaining the title of Lord Hokage\\n You'll have to beat me first.\\n Who do you think you are, lecturing me like that?\\n I won't be your apprentice anymore.\\n From now on, you're my rival.\\n Unfortunately for you, tomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy.\\n Still, I'll consider you an equal someday when we fight for the title of Lord Hokage.\\n Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru.\\n You still have a long way to go to become a real Ninja.\\n Aaah! Why do I have to be in the same group with Sasuke?\\n The guy I hate the most?\\n Sakura keeps saying  \\\"Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!\\\"\\n and doesn't even pay attention to me!\\n It makes me so mad! I got it!

I-I will finish it no time!\\n Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!\\n Naruto.\\n Why did you vandalize those faces?\\n Don't you know who the Hokage leaders are?\\n Of course, I do!\\n I know they earned the title Lord Hokage\\n because they were the best Ninja of their time, right?\\n Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero\\n who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox.\\n Then why did you do that?\\n Because I'll become a Hokage myself.\\n And I'll be the greatest Hokage of all time!\\n So that everyone will finally learn to accept me!\\n By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask.\\n You want another bowl?\\n Mmmm\\u2026No\\u2026\\n Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while?\\n This?\\n No no!\\n This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy.\\n Tomorrow, you will\\u2026\\n You're so mean!\\n So that's why you took off your goggles\\u2026\\n Humph... One more bowl please!\\n We are now about to begin the graduation test.\\n When your name is called, proceed to the next classroom.\\n The test is on the Clone Jutsu.\\n Oh no\\u2026\\n Of all the\\u2026! That is my weakest Jutsu!\\n But still\\u2026 I will do it no matter what!\\n Clone Jutsu!\\n Disqualified!\\n Iruka Sensei.\\n His physical coordination and stamina are excellent.\\n And he managed to come up with something.\\n Isn't that enough for him to pass?\\n Mizuki Sensei... All the others created three or more clones.\\n Naruto created just one.\\n And it's practically useless. I can't give him a passing mark.\\n I 'm a Ninja now!\\n You did well. That's my son.\\n Congratulations for your graduation.\\n I'll cook something good tonight!\\n Look at that one.\\n It's that boy. I hear he's the only one who failed.\\n Serves him right.\\n Imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja.\\n Isn't that the boy who is actually\\u2026\\n Hey! We're not supposed to talk about that.\\n Iruka. We need to talk later.\\n Yes, sir.\\n Iruka Sensei isn't trying to be mean to you.\\n Then why only me?\\n He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart.\\n You both don't have parents.\\n But I really wanted to graduate.\\n Heh... I guess I have no choice\\u2026\\n I'll let you in on a big secret.\\n Secret?\\n Iruka.\\n What is it, Lord Hokage?\\n I know how you feel. But\\u2026\\n Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parents\\u2026like you.\\n Let me go!\\n My mom and dad are still out there fighting!\\n Wake up, Iruka Sensei!\\n What's the matter?\\n Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!\\n I heard that Naruto\\u2026 stole the Scroll of Sealing.\\n The Scroll of Sealing?!\\n Let's see\\u2026\\n The first Jutsu is\\u2026 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?\\n What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?\\n Lord Hokage! We can't forgive him!\\n This is not just a prank!\\n The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed!\\n Depending on its use\\u2026\\n It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village!\\n Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!\\n Yes, sir!\\n Where did you go\\u2026Naruto?\\n I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Naruto\\u2026\\n Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine!\\n Hey you, Naruto!\\n You found me..\\n And I've only learned one Jutsu.\\n He's been practicing the Jutsu\\u2026\\n until he's become this exhausted and dirty\\u2026?\\n Listen, listen! I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!\\n You're gonna let me graduate if I can do it!\\n Isn't it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here?\\n Who told you that?\\n Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place\\u2026\\n Mizuki did?!\\n I'm impressed you found this place.\\n I see now\\u2026how it is.\\n Naruto, give me that scroll.\\n Wait, wait\\u2026 What's going on here?\\n Naruto! Never give him that scroll!\\n It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.\\n Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself!\\n W-Wha--?\\n Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll!\\n Huh?\\n What are you saying, Mizuki! Don't let him fool you, Naruto!\\n I will tell you the truth.\\n Idiot! Don't do that!\\n After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created.\\n A rule?\\n That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows.\\n Except me?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is it?\\n Stop it, Mizuki!\\n The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!\\n Huh?\\n You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,\\n who killed Iruka's parents and destroyed our village!\\n Stop it!\\n Everyone has been deceiving you ever since.\\n Didn't you find it strange?\\n Why everyone hated you so much?\\n No! No! No! No! No!\\n Naruto\\u2026\\n Nobody accepts you. That's why Iruka hates you so much!\\n Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents.\\n Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened.\\n That's why he keeps misbehaving.\\n It's the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement.\\n He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting.\\n Die, Naruto!\\n Naruto! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGet down!\\n Why\\u2026?\\n Because you and I are the same.\\n After my parents died,\\n nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support.\\n I wasn't a good student in school.\\n I was the class clown\\u2026 because I wanted people to notice me.\\n I couldn't get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things.\\n It was so hard.\\n Isn't that right, Naruto?\\n You felt so lonely\\u2026right? And you suffered inside, right?\\n I'm sorry, Naruto\\u2026.\\n If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.\\n Don't make me laugh!\\n Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents!\\n He's just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back!\\n Naruto!\\n Narutoooooo!\\n He is not the type of kid who will change his mind.\\n He will take revenge against our village using that scroll!\\n Didn't you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.\\n No\\u2026 Naruto\\u2026isn't\\u2026like that at all!\\n All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll.\\n I'll take care of you later!\\n I-I won't let you\\u2026\\n Well, well.\\n Mizuki has a big mouth!\\n Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.\\n He might unleash the power locked up inside him.\\n The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.\\n There's a slight chance he might actually release\\n the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him!\\n If that happens\\u2026\\n I've found him!\\n Naruto!\\n Everything that Mizuki said was a lie!\\n Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll!\\n It can't be\\u2026\\n Why is it, Naruto?\\n How\\u2026\\n did you know I wasn't Iruka\\u2026?\\n Because I'm Iruka.\\n I see.\\n What's in it for you to protect the one who killed your family?\\n I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll!\\n You're the idiot. Naruto is the same as me.\\n Same?\\n Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll.\\n There is no way that that monster\\u2026\\n that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage of the power of that scroll!\\n You're right\\u2026\\n I guess it was true all along!\\n See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all!\\n ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n But Naruto is different!\\n I know that he is an exceptional student.\\n He works very hard,\\n and he's single-minded and clumsy at the same time.\\n No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering.\\n He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n He's Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!\\n You are so gullible. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlruka!\\n I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind.\\n Die!\\n I guess this is the end for me\\u2026\\n Naruto?!\\n You surprised me there, freak.\\n If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you!\\n Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow!\\n Why don't you try then? I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!\\n Let's see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu!\\n Naruto! You've\\u2026\\n Those aren't just images but actual clones! That's an advanced Ninjutsu!\\n What's this\\u2026?\\n What's the matter? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC'mon!\\n Weren't you gonna get me with one blow? Here!\\n In that case\\u2026 I'll come to you.\\n I kinda got carried away. lruka Sensei, are you okay?\\n Yeah.\\n He's really something.\\n Maybe it is true.\\n Maybe he will surpass all the Hokage leaders\\u2026\\n Naruto, come over here. I'd like to give you something.\\n Has anyone found Naruto yet?\\n No.\\n Darn, this is going to be bad\\u2026\\n There's no need to worry anymore.\\n Lord Hokage!\\n He'll be back soon.\\n Sensei, how much longer?\\n OK, you may open your eyes now.\\n Congratulations\\u2026on your graduation.\\n In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight!\\n Iruka Sensei!\\n That hurts!\\n Naruto\\u2026\\n I was going to lecture to you...\\n that the road gets more difficult now that you're a Ninja.\\n But I guess I'll just wait to tell you that until we get to the ramen stand\\u2026\\n W-What do you want, you little shrimp? Quit following me!\\n You're smaller than me and\\n you're saying that you're gonna become the Fifth Hokage?\\n I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage's grandson or not.\\n It's not that easy to be a Hokage!\\n If you want it that bad, you're gonna have to beat me first!\\n Next episode:  \\\"My Name Is Konohamaru!\\\"\\n Watch my outstanding performance!\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"dialogue\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0014585970598407652,\n        \"min\": 0.9585433006286621,\n        \"max\": 0.9606060683727264,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9606060683727264,\n          0.9585433006286621\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"betrayal\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.25651348954540626,\n        \"min\": 0.42994377948343754,\n        \"max\": 0.7927086353302002,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.42994377948343754,\n          0.7927086353302002\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"battle\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.050603624201317046,\n        \"min\": 0.6848458498716354,\n        \"max\": 0.7564101815223694,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.6848458498716354,\n          0.7564101815223694\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sacrifice\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.07759009325216058,\n        \"min\": 0.5707037150859833,\n        \"max\": 0.6804326772689819,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5707037150859833,\n          0.6804326772689819\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"self development\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.22298553062646534,\n        \"min\": 0.48281005024909973,\n        \"max\": 0.7981592118740082,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.48281005024909973,\n          0.7981592118740082\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"hope\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.03332971002171328,\n        \"min\": 0.15453363489359617,\n        \"max\": 0.20166896283626556,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.15453363489359617,\n          0.20166896283626556\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"friendship\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.01864464625555595,\n        \"min\": 0.04626081511378288,\n        \"max\": 0.07262832671403885,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.04626081511378288,\n          0.07262832671403885\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"love\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.09837266819757061,\n        \"min\": 0.03414125647395849,\n        \"max\": 0.1732612180057913,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.1732612180057913,\n          0.03414125647395849\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Get ready to fight!\\n I am going to be the Fifth Hokage!\\n Ouch!\\n If it's not one thing, it's another\\u2026.\\n Drat! Is this a trap?\\n Are you okay, Honorable Grandson?\\n May I just inform you that there aren't any traps here\\u2026\\n Huh? What's with this runt?\\n What?!\\n I know this kid\\u2026 He's that Nine-Tailed boy!\\n He's a good-for-nothing scoundrel!\\n You must have done this to me!\\n You tripped all by yourself, stupid!\\n Hey! Let go of him!\\n He is the Honorable Grandson of the Third Hokage!\\n He stopped as soon as he learned who I am\\u2026.\\n He's like my four-eyed teacher.\\n He's just like everyone else!\\n What's the matter?\\n Weren't you gonna hit me, huh?\\n Can't do it 'cuz I'm the Hokage's grandson, eh?\\n As if I care! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlmbecile!\\n This guy\\u2026\\n What?!\\n Good grief\\u2026\\n Listen to me.\\n You are the Honorable Grandson of the Third Hokage.\\n Even though that scoundrel hit you, you must not associate with his kind.\\n Nothing good will come of your tangling with him.\\n This is your distinguished teacher Ebisu,\\n and I am never wrong about these things!\\n Don't you want to become the Fifth Hokage?\\n Then allow me to teach you Ninjutsu,\\n so that your dream will become a reality.\\n That's right.\\n Stick with me and you will gain a shortcut towards becoming the Fifth Hokage.\\n Is that clear, Honorable Grandson?\\n He's gone!\\n It seems he's gone after Naruto.\\n Oh no!\\n This is terrible!\\n Honorable Grandson!\\n How did he become like this?\\n That was the 20th sneak attack today.\\n And now he's in the company of Naruto.

Boss! Boss!\\n I guess I have no choice.\\n Listen.\\n In order to become a skilled Ninja,\\n you must first learn to control your Chatora.\\n Chatora?\\n Yes, Chatora.\\n Boss, I think you mean Chakra.\\n Silence!\\n That's what real Ninjas call it!\\n Oh! I didn't know that!\\n Whew\\u2026 I'm glad he's a fool.\\n Listen. Chakra essentially means\\u2026\\n Basically, it is the energy needed in order to use Jutsu.\\n Huh?\\n In other words, fundamentally Ninja Arts combine the Chakra,\\n the physical energy accumulated from each cell in the body\\n with spiritual energy intensified through training and experience.\\n This combined energy is summoned with certain hand signs.\\n You made me think you knew all that,\\n when you were just reading from a scroll!\\n Much has been said about perfecting the Ninja techniques,\\n but it really boils down to just one thing.\\n And what is that?\\n Hard work and guts.\\n Hard work and guts?\\n That's right.\\n So be ready for the challenging tasks I will give you.\\n Yes, boss!\\n Good. Let's start right now. Transform for me.\\n Huh?\\n Let me see first how much you already know.\\n But what do I transform into?\\n OK... First, transform into that lady.\\n An easy task, boss.\\n Transform!\\n Well, do I look like her?\\n Uhm\\u2026 Well, the clothes do and\\u2026\\n And what's so similar about that?!\\n Honorable Grandson.\\n If you will transform into me, at least try to look a little cuter, OK?\\n She's scary!\\n Why am I the one who gets hit?\\n OK! Next, we'll do some research on sexiness!\\n Yes, boss!\\n I told you I don't allow reading here, Naruto!\\n This is the last test. Put all of your effort into it!\\n Yes, boss!\\n Transform!\\n Naruto! It's you again!\\n Why is it always me\\u2026?\\n Sorry.\\n Huh?\\n It's because I'm the Hokage's grandson.\\n Don't worry about it.\\n Huh?\\n You're now ready to perform the Sexy Jutsu!\\n You just need more practice.\\n Yes, boss!\\n OK, keep in mind\\u2026 the point is for \\\"boom boom boom\\\"!\\n Now do it!\\n Yes, boss! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTransform!\\n What do you think?\\n That won't do!\\n More slender.\\n Yes, boss!\\n Is this okay?\\n Not yet. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMore attractive.\\n Yes, boss!\\n How about now?\\n That Naruto\\u2026 What is he teaching the Honorable Grandson\\u2026?\\n Where the hell could they be\\u2026?\\n I am a distinguished teacher training potential Hokage.\\n All those who interfere will be eliminated.\\n You know I've been wondering\\u2026\\n You seem obsessed with beating your Grandpa Hokage.\\n My name is Konohamaru.\\n It was Grandpa who gave me that name.\\n He named me after our village.\\n It should be easy for everyone here to remember.\\n But nobody ever calls me by that name.\\n When they see me, all they see is the grandson of Lord Hokage.\\n No one sees me for who I really am.\\n I can't stand it anymore.\\n That's why\\u2026\\n That's why I want the title of Lord Hokage now.\\n Idiot\\u2026Who do you think will accept you, huh?\\n Huh?\\n You won't win the title that easily, you know.\\n What?!\\n It's not that simple.\\n If you're really serious about gaining the title of Lord Hokage\\u2026\\n What?\\n You'll have to beat me first!\\n Lord Hokage! I've been looking for you.\\n Iruka.\\n Did Naruto re-submit his Ninja Registration Form?\\n Yes.\\n When I lectured to him the other night at the ramen stand,\\n he said he will make everyone accept him now that he's a Ninja.\\n He's been happy since then.\\n It might not be easy for Naruto to realize that dream.\\n Huh?\\n As you well know,\\n only the villagers who fought the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit 12 years ago\\n know that the monster is sealed inside Naruto.\\n I ruled that no one shall speak about that incident.\\n I have severely punished those who have broken this rule.\\n Now our children know nothing about it.\\n That is the only positive development for Naruto.\\n Before the Fourth Hokage trapped the monster and died,\\n his last wish was for the villagers to regard Naruto as a hero.\\n A hero?\\n The Fourth Hokage sealed the monster into the navel of a newborn baby\\n whose umbilical cord had just been cut.\\n As the receptacle for the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,\\n Naruto saved the village.\\n Unfortunately, the other villagers don't see him like that.\\n Some even say that Naruto is the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit himself.\\n Little by little, that attitude has been passed down to their own children.\\n Iruka. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDo you know?\\n What, sir?\\n When someone is hated and people refuse to accept his existence,\\n he sees it in the eyes of the people around him.\\n I have found you!\\n Huh?\\n That Demon Fox!!\\n That cold look! lt's always like that!\\n Honorable Grandson, we have to go now.\\n No way!\\n I want to beat Grandpa right now so I can win the title of Lord Hokage!\\n Don't get in my way!\\n A Hokage must first know about virtue, honor, etiquette, wisdom, loyalty, faith,\\n judgment, obedience and all that.\\n He must be skilled at more than thousand techniques\\u2026\\n And then...\\n Transform!\\n Take this! Sexy Jutsu!\\n What? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlt didn't work!\\n What kind of a disgraceful spell is that?!\\n I am a gentleman!\\n Such vulgar attacks will never work on me!\\n Honorable Grandson! That rascal will only make you an imbecile!\\n Stick with me and...\\n you will gain a shortcut towards becoming the Fifth Hokage.\\n C'mon, let's go!\\n No way!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu\\n Wow! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFantastic!\\n Ha! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat's nothing.\\n I am a distinguished teacher.\\n I am not as weak as Mizuki.\\n Boss\\u2026\\n Transform!\\n Transform!\\n Oh, Master Ebisu\\u2026\\n I call it \\\"the Harem Jutsu\\\"!\\n He combined the Multiple Clones with his own Sexy Jutsu.\\n That's another devious attack.\\n I probably won't even survive that one.\\n I can't even beat that four-eyed teacher of mine!\\n I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly! I want to be recognized by everybody!\\n But I keep failing.\\n You think it's that easy?\\n Huh?\\n It's given only to the greatest Ninja in the village.\\n Everybody must learn to believe in you.\\n I've been through a lot already.\\n It's been one struggle after another.\\n But after all that, I found someone who accepts me.\\n I had to go through a lot... Just for one person.\\n You had better push yourself.\\n For what?\\n The path of getting the title, Lord Hokage, is a brutal one.\\n There's no such thing as a shortcut.\\n If you're really serious about attaining the title of Lord Hokage\\n You'll have to beat me first.\\n Who do you think you are, lecturing me like that?\\n I won't be your apprentice anymore.\\n From now on, you're my rival.\\n Unfortunately for you, tomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy.\\n Still, I'll consider you an equal someday when we fight for the title of Lord Hokage.\\n Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru.\\n You still have a long way to go to become a real Ninja.\\n Aaah! Why do I have to be in the same group with Sasuke?\\n The guy I hate the most?\\n Sakura keeps saying  \\\"Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!\\\"\\n and doesn't even pay attention to me!\\n It makes me so mad! I got it! I'm going to pull one on him!\\n I'm not gonna let him be so cool in front of Sakura!\\n Next Episode:  \\\"Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?\\\"\\n Watch my outstanding performance!\\n\",\n          \"A long time ago, a powerful demon fox appeared with nine tails.\\n With its powerful tails,\\n it could smash mountains and create tidal waves.\\n A band of Ninjas rose to defend their village from attack.\\n We have to wait until the Fourth Hokage gets here!\\n We can't let it get any closer to our village!\\n One great Ninja was able to imprison the monster,\\n but died in the process.\\n This Ninja was known as\\u2026 the Fourth Hokage.\\n Naruto!\\n Why did you do such a thing?!\\n You're really gonna get it this time!\\n I don't care!\\n You know your problem?\\n You can't do the things I do!\\n Only I can do this!\\n I'm better than all of you! Believe it!\\n There's a problem, sir!\\n Lord Hokage!\\n What is it?\\n Did that Naruto do something again?\\n Yes. He climbed onto the Mountainside Images\\u2026\\n And he vandalized and graffitied all over them!\\n Wait!\\n Ha ha\\u2026\\n Why should I?\\n Hey, Naruto!\\n How did you suddenly get here, lruka Sensei?\\n The question is what are you doing here when you should be in class now?\\n Now listen, Naruto.\\n You failed the last graduation test and the one before that.\\n This is no time to be goofing off, you fool!\\n We will have a re-test on the Transformation Jutsu!\\n Even those who already passed will take it!\\n Whaaaat?!\\n Sakura Haruno. Here I go\\u2026\\n Transform!\\n OK!\\n I did it!\\n Cha!\\n Did you see that, Sasuke?\\n Next, Sasuke Uchiha.\\n Yes.\\n O-OK.\\n Next, Naruto Uzumaki.\\n This is a real pain.\\n And it's all your fault.\\n Like I care!!\\n OK\\u2026\\n Good luck, Naruto\\u2026\\n Transform!\\n How was it?\\n I call it the \\\"Sexy Jutsu\\\"!\\n You fool! Stop making idiotic spells!\\n Darn\\u2026\\n Darn\\u2026\\n I won't let you go home unless you clean that all up.\\n I don't care\\u2026\\n There's nobody home anyway.\\n Naruto...\\n What is it this time?\\n What I meant was\\u2026\\n If you clean up all that mess, I'll buy you ramen tonight.\\n Huh?!\\n Yes! I-I will finish it no time!\\n Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!\\n Naruto.\\n Why did you vandalize those faces?\\n Don't you know who the Hokage leaders are?\\n Of course, I do!\\n I know they earned the title Lord Hokage\\n because they were the best Ninja of their time, right?\\n Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero\\n who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox.\\n Then why did you do that?\\n Because I'll become a Hokage myself.\\n And I'll be the greatest Hokage of all time!\\n So that everyone will finally learn to accept me!\\n By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask.\\n You want another bowl?\\n Mmmm\\u2026No\\u2026\\n Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while?\\n This?\\n No no!\\n This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy.\\n Tomorrow, you will\\u2026\\n You're so mean!\\n So that's why you took off your goggles\\u2026\\n Humph... One more bowl please!\\n We are now about to begin the graduation test.\\n When your name is called, proceed to the next classroom.\\n The test is on the Clone Jutsu.\\n Oh no\\u2026\\n Of all the\\u2026! That is my weakest Jutsu!\\n But still\\u2026 I will do it no matter what!\\n Clone Jutsu!\\n Disqualified!\\n Iruka Sensei.\\n His physical coordination and stamina are excellent.\\n And he managed to come up with something.\\n Isn't that enough for him to pass?\\n Mizuki Sensei... All the others created three or more clones.\\n Naruto created just one.\\n And it's practically useless. I can't give him a passing mark.\\n I 'm a Ninja now!\\n You did well. That's my son.\\n Congratulations for your graduation.\\n I'll cook something good tonight!\\n Look at that one.\\n It's that boy. I hear he's the only one who failed.\\n Serves him right.\\n Imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja.\\n Isn't that the boy who is actually\\u2026\\n Hey! We're not supposed to talk about that.\\n Iruka. We need to talk later.\\n Yes, sir.\\n Iruka Sensei isn't trying to be mean to you.\\n Then why only me?\\n He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart.\\n You both don't have parents.\\n But I really wanted to graduate.\\n Heh... I guess I have no choice\\u2026\\n I'll let you in on a big secret.\\n Secret?\\n Iruka.\\n What is it, Lord Hokage?\\n I know how you feel. But\\u2026\\n Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parents\\u2026like you.\\n Let me go!\\n My mom and dad are still out there fighting!\\n Wake up, Iruka Sensei!\\n What's the matter?\\n Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!\\n I heard that Naruto\\u2026 stole the Scroll of Sealing.\\n The Scroll of Sealing?!\\n Let's see\\u2026\\n The first Jutsu is\\u2026 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?\\n What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?\\n Lord Hokage! We can't forgive him!\\n This is not just a prank!\\n The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed!\\n Depending on its use\\u2026\\n It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village!\\n Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!\\n Yes, sir!\\n Where did you go\\u2026Naruto?\\n I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Naruto\\u2026\\n Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine!\\n Hey you, Naruto!\\n You found me..\\n And I've only learned one Jutsu.\\n He's been practicing the Jutsu\\u2026\\n until he's become this exhausted and dirty\\u2026?\\n Listen, listen! I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!\\n You're gonna let me graduate if I can do it!\\n Isn't it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here?\\n Who told you that?\\n Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place\\u2026\\n Mizuki did?!\\n I'm impressed you found this place.\\n I see now\\u2026how it is.\\n Naruto, give me that scroll.\\n Wait, wait\\u2026 What's going on here?\\n Naruto! Never give him that scroll!\\n It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.\\n Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself!\\n W-Wha--?\\n Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll!\\n Huh?\\n What are you saying, Mizuki! Don't let him fool you, Naruto!\\n I will tell you the truth.\\n Idiot! Don't do that!\\n After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created.\\n A rule?\\n That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows.\\n Except me?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is it?\\n Stop it, Mizuki!\\n The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!\\n Huh?\\n You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,\\n who killed Iruka's parents and destroyed our village!\\n Stop it!\\n Everyone has been deceiving you ever since.\\n Didn't you find it strange?\\n Why everyone hated you so much?\\n No! No! No! No! No!\\n Naruto\\u2026\\n Nobody accepts you. That's why Iruka hates you so much!\\n Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents.\\n Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened.\\n That's why he keeps misbehaving.\\n It's the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement.\\n He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting.\\n Die, Naruto!\\n Naruto! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGet down!\\n Why\\u2026?\\n Because you and I are the same.\\n After my parents died,\\n nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support.\\n I wasn't a good student in school.\\n I was the class clown\\u2026 because I wanted people to notice me.\\n I couldn't get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things.\\n It was so hard.\\n Isn't that right, Naruto?\\n You felt so lonely\\u2026right? And you suffered inside, right?\\n I'm sorry, Naruto\\u2026.\\n If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.\\n Don't make me laugh!\\n Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents!\\n He's just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back!\\n Naruto!\\n Narutoooooo!\\n He is not the type of kid who will change his mind.\\n He will take revenge against our village using that scroll!\\n Didn't you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.\\n No\\u2026 Naruto\\u2026isn't\\u2026like that at all!\\n All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll.\\n I'll take care of you later!\\n I-I won't let you\\u2026\\n Well, well.\\n Mizuki has a big mouth!\\n Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.\\n He might unleash the power locked up inside him.\\n The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.\\n There's a slight chance he might actually release\\n the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him!\\n If that happens\\u2026\\n I've found him!\\n Naruto!\\n Everything that Mizuki said was a lie!\\n Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll!\\n It can't be\\u2026\\n Why is it, Naruto?\\n How\\u2026\\n did you know I wasn't Iruka\\u2026?\\n Because I'm Iruka.\\n I see.\\n What's in it for you to protect the one who killed your family?\\n I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll!\\n You're the idiot. Naruto is the same as me.\\n Same?\\n Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll.\\n There is no way that that monster\\u2026\\n that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage of the power of that scroll!\\n You're right\\u2026\\n I guess it was true all along!\\n See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all!\\n ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n But Naruto is different!\\n I know that he is an exceptional student.\\n He works very hard,\\n and he's single-minded and clumsy at the same time.\\n No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering.\\n He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n He's Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!\\n You are so gullible. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlruka!\\n I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind.\\n Die!\\n I guess this is the end for me\\u2026\\n Naruto?!\\n You surprised me there, freak.\\n If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you!\\n Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow!\\n Why don't you try then? I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!\\n Let's see you try!
