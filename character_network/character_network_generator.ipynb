I guess I have no choice…\\n I\\'ll let you in on a big secret.\\n Secret?\\n Iruka.\\n What is it, Lord Hokage?\\n I know how you feel. But…\\n Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parents…like you.\\n Let me go!\\n My mom and dad are still out there fighting!\\n Wake up, Iruka Sensei!\\n What\\'s the matter?\\n Come to Lord Hokage\\'s immediately!\\n I heard that Naruto… stole the Scroll of Sealing.\\n The Scroll of Sealing?!\\n Let\\'s see…\\n The first Jutsu is… Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?\\n What?! Already a Jutsu I\\'m no good at?\\n Lord Hokage! We can\\'t forgive him!\\n This is not just a prank!\\n The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed!\\n Depending on its use…\\n It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village!\\n Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!\\n Yes, sir!\\n Where did you go…Naruto?\\n I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Naruto…\\n Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine!\\n Hey you, Naruto!\\n You found me..\\n And I\\'ve only learned one Jutsu.\\n He\\'s been practicing the Jutsu…\\n until he\\'s become this exhausted and dirty…?\\n Listen, listen! I\\'m gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!\\n You\\'re gonna let me graduate if I can do it!\\n Isn\\'t it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here?\\n Who told you that?\\n Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place…\\n Mizuki did?!\\n I\\'m impressed you found this place.\\n I see now…how it is.\\n Naruto, give me that scroll.\\n Wait, wait… What\\'s going on here?\\n Naruto! Never give him that scroll!\\n It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.\\n Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself!\\n W-Wha--?\\n Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll!\\n Huh?\\n What are you saying, Mizuki! Don\\'t let him fool you, Naruto!\\n I will tell you the truth.\\n Idiot! Don\\'t do that!\\n After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created.\\n A rule?\\n That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows.\\n Except me?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is it?\\n Stop it, Mizuki!\\n The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!\\n Huh?\\n You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,\\n who killed Iruka\\'s parents and destroyed our village!\\n Stop it!\\n Everyone has been deceiving you ever since.\\n Didn\\'t you find it strange?\\n Why everyone hated you so much?\\n No! No! No! No! No!\\n Naruto…\\n Nobody accepts you. That\\'s why Iruka hates you so much!\\n Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents.\\n Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened.\\n That\\'s why he keeps misbehaving.\\n It\\'s the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement.\\n He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting.\\n Die, Naruto!\\n Naruto! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGet down!\\n Why…?\\n Because you and I are the same.\\n After my parents died,\\n nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support.\\n I wasn\\'t a good student in school.\\n I was the class clown… because I wanted people to notice me.\\n I couldn\\'t get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things.\\n It was so hard.\\n Isn\\'t that right, Naruto?\\n You felt so lonely…right? And you suffered inside, right?\\n I\\'m sorry, Naruto….\\n If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn\\'t have suffered so much.\\n Don\\'t make me laugh!\\n Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents!\\n He\\'s just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back!\\n Naruto!\\n Narutoooooo!\\n He is not the type of kid who will change his mind.\\n He will take revenge against our village using that scroll!\\n Didn\\'t you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.\\n No… Naruto…isn\\'t…like that at all!\\n All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll.\\n I\\'ll take care of you later!\\n I-I won\\'t let you…\\n Well, well.\\n Mizuki has a big mouth!\\n Naruto feels worse than he\\'s ever felt.\\n He might unleash the power locked up inside him.\\n The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.\\n There\\'s a slight chance he might actually release\\n the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him!\\n If that happens…\\n I\\'ve found him!\\n Naruto!\\n Everything that Mizuki said was a lie!\\n Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll!\\n It can\\'t be…\\n Why is it, Naruto?\\n How…\\n did you know I wasn\\'t Iruka…?\\n Because I\\'m Iruka.\\n I see.\\n What\\'s in it for you to protect the one who killed your family?\\n I\\'m not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll!\\n You\\'re the idiot. Naruto is the same as me.\\n Same?\\n Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll.\\n There is no way that that monster…\\n that Fox Spirit, won\\'t take advantage of the power of that scroll!\\n You\\'re right…\\n I guess it was true all along!\\n See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all!\\n ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n But Naruto is different!\\n I know that he is an exceptional student.\\n He works very hard,\\n and he\\'s single-minded and clumsy at the same time.\\n No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering.\\n He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n He\\'s Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!\\n You are so gullible. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlruka!\\n I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind.\\n Die!\\n I guess this is the end for me…\\n Naruto?!\\n You surprised me there, freak.\\n If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I\\'ll kill you!\\n Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow!\\n Why don\\'t you try then? I\\'ll strike you back a thousand-fold!\\n Let\\'s see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu!\\n Naruto! You\\'ve…\\n Those aren\\'t just images but actual clones! That\\'s an advanced Ninjutsu!\\n What\\'s this…?\\n What\\'s the matter? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC\\'mon!\\n Weren\\'t you gonna get me with one blow? Here!\\n In that case… I\\'ll come to you.\\n I kinda got carried away. lruka Sensei, are you okay?\\n Yeah.\\n He\\'s really something.\\n Maybe it is true.\\n Maybe he will surpass all the Hokage leaders…\\n Naruto, come over here. I\\'d like to give you something.\\n Has anyone found Naruto yet?\\n No.\\n Darn, this is going to be bad…\\n There\\'s no need to worry anymore.\\n Lord Hokage!\\n He\\'ll be back soon.\\n Sensei, how much longer?\\n OK, you may open your eyes now.\\n Congratulations…on your graduation.\\n In celebration, we\\'ll have ramen tonight!\\n Iruka Sensei!\\n That hurts!\\n Naruto…\\n I was going to lecture to you...\\n that the road gets more difficult now that you\\'re a Ninja.\\n But I guess I\\'ll just wait to tell you that until we get to the ramen stand…\\n W-What do you want, you little shrimp? Quit following me!\\n You\\'re smaller than me and\\n you\\'re saying that you\\'re gonna become the Fifth Hokage?\\n I don\\'t care if you are the 3rd Hokage\\'s grandson or not.\\n It\\'s not that easy to be a Hokage!\\n If you want it that bad, you\\'re gonna have to beat me first!\\n Next episode:  \"My Name Is Konohamaru!\"\\n Watch my outstanding performance!\\n'"

Sexy Jutsu!\\n What? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlt didn't work!\\n What kind of a disgraceful spell is that?!\\n I am a gentleman!\\n Such vulgar attacks will never work on me!\\n Honorable Grandson! That rascal will only make you an imbecile!\\n Stick with me and...\\n you will gain a shortcut towards becoming the Fifth Hokage.\\n C'mon, let's go!\\n No way!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu\\n Wow! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFantastic!\\n Ha! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat's nothing.\\n I am a distinguished teacher.\\n I am not as weak as Mizuki.\\n Boss\\u2026\\n Transform!\\n Transform!\\n Oh, Master Ebisu\\u2026\\n I call it \\\"the Harem Jutsu\\\"!\\n He combined the Multiple Clones with his own Sexy Jutsu.\\n That's another devious attack.\\n I probably won't even survive that one.\\n I can't even beat that four-eyed teacher of mine!\\n I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly! I want to be recognized by everybody!\\n But I keep failing.\\n You think it's that easy?\\n Huh?\\n It's given only to the greatest Ninja in the village.\\n Everybody must learn to believe in you.\\n I've been through a lot already.\\n It's been one struggle after another.\\n But after all that, I found someone who accepts me.\\n I had to go through a lot... Just for one person.\\n You had better push yourself.\\n For what?\\n The path of getting the title, Lord Hokage, is a brutal one.\\n There's no such thing as a shortcut.\\n If you're really serious about attaining the title of Lord Hokage\\n You'll have to beat me first.\\n Who do you think you are, lecturing me like that?\\n I won't be your apprentice anymore.\\n From now on, you're my rival.\\n Unfortunately for you, tomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy.\\n Still, I'll consider you an equal someday when we fight for the title of Lord Hokage.\\n Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru.\\n You still have a long way to go to become a real Ninja.\\n Aaah! Why do I have to be in the same group with Sasuke?\\n The guy I hate the most?\\n Sakura keeps saying  \\\"Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!\\\"\\n and doesn't even pay attention to me!\\n It makes me so mad!

He's alive!\\n Humph! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tShow off\\u2026\\n Whaa--?!\\n Then, what was that\\u2026?\\n So Kakashi Sensei\\u2026used Substitutions\\u2026\\n Naruto\\u2026 Sorry I didn't help you right away\\u2026\\n I got you hurt.\\n I didn't think you'd be incapable of moving\\u2026\\n I was saved, somehow\\u2026\\n Anyhow, let me just say, good job, Sasuke.\\n You, too, Sakura.\\n I\\u2026couldn't do anything\\u2026\\n but Sasuke\\u2026\\n It was his first real battle\\u2026\\n Didn't he feel scared, at all?\\n He saved me like it was nothing and without getting any dirt on his clothes\\u2026\\n Hey\\u2026\\n Huh?!\\n Are you hurt\\u2026\\n scaredy cat...?\\n Sasuke!\\n Naruto!\\n These guys have poison on their claws.\\n You need to take out the poison quickly.\\n What?!\\n You have to open the wound and drain the poisoned blood.\\n Don't move so much.\\n The poison will spread.\\n By the way, Mr. Tazuna\\u2026\\n W-What is it\\u2026?!\\n I have something to talk to you about.\\n Chunin from the Village Hidden in the Mist\\u2026\\n These guys are Ninjas known for continuing to fight\\n no matter what the sacrifice.\\n How were you able to detect our movements?\\n There probably wouldn't be  puddles of water\\n on a clear day like today, when it hasn't rained for days.\\n Knowing that, why'd you leave it to the kids to fight?\\n If I felt like it, I could kill these guys instantly\\u2026\\n But\\u2026 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI had to know...\\n who the target of these enemies was\\u2026\\n Hm?! What do you mean?\\n In other words...\\n what I mean is I had to know if it was you,\\n or one of us Shinobi\\u2026 who was being targeted.\\n We haven't heard anything about you being targeted by Ninjas.\\n The content of the request was supposed to just be\\n protection from gangs, thieves, and the like\\u2026\\n This is a mission with a B rank or higher.\\n The request was supposed to be\\n for backup protection until you finished building your bridge\\u2026\\n If our enemies were to be Ninjas,\\n the mission would've been estimated without question\\n as an expensive  \\\"B Rank\\\"  mission.\\n It appears there's some kind of good reason for this,\\n but being lied to in the request won't do.\\n This is beyond the scope of our mission.\\n This mission is too soon for us\\u2026\\n Let's give it up!\\n We need an anesthetic to open Naruto's wound\\n and get out the poisoned blood\\u2026\\n We have to return to the village and take him to a doctor\\u2026\\n Hmmm\\u2026\\n Hm? What...?!\\n This sure is a burden!\\n Since we need to treat Naruto's wound, shall we go back to the village\\u2026?\\n Huh!\\n Oh!\\n Why am I so different?!\\n Why's it always me\\u2026 Darn it!\\n Naruto! What're you doing?!\\n I should be getting stronger\\u2026\\n Here I'm steadily carrying out missions and\\n doing special-skill training by myself every day\\u2026\\n I'll never get into another situation from which I'll have to be rescued.\\n I'll never be afraid or a be a coward\\u2026\\n I won't lose to Sasuke\\u2026\\n I'm going to swear on the pain of my left hand!\\n I'll protect you, old man\\u2026 with this Kunai knife!!\\n The mission continues!!\\n Naruto\\u2026\\n It's all well and good to rid yourself of the poisoned blood,\\n but any more than that and you'll bleed to death.\\n Things will get hairy if you don't stop the bleeding quick... Seriously!\\n Yikes!\\n Argh! No! No!\\n I can't die like this, I say!\\n Show me your hand.\\n Nooo! Help me!!\\n Naruto!\\n You're really self-abusive, aren't you!\\n That's masochistic!\\n The wound is\\u2026\\n already starting to heal\\u2026\\n Um\\u2026um\\u2026\\n Am I okay? You look awfully serious\\u2026\\n Well\\u2026You should be okay.\\n Is it\\u2026the power of the Nine-Tailed Fox\\u2026?\\n Did you say you failed?!\\n I paid a lot of money to hire you guys\\n because you said you were once hot-shot Ninjas!\\n Stop your darned grumbling\\u2026!!\\n Next time, I'll kill him with this\\u2026 head chopper!\\n I-It's really okay, right?!\\n It seems that the enemy has hired good Ninjas\\u2026\\n On top of that, a tightened guard on account of the Demon Brothers' failure\\n means that it won't be easy\\u2026\\n Just who do you think I am?!\\n This Zabuza Momochi, who is called the demon of\\u2026\\n the Hidden Mist!!\\n We've finally landed ashore in the Land of the Waves.\\n The guys before were all well and good,\\n but there should be even stronger guys lying in wait.\\n Okay! I'm going to regain my honor and continue the mission.\\n No matter what enemy comes,\\n I'll protect the old man this time around for sure.\\n Oh, they wasted no time.\\n An impressive-looking guy with a huge Katana has come.\\n Next episode:  \\\"The Assassin of the Mist!\\\"\\n I'm going to kick butt once again!\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Sexy Jutsu!\\n What? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlt didn't work!\\n What kind of a disgraceful spell is that?!\\n I am a gentleman!\\n Such vulgar attacks will never work on me!\\n Honorable Grandson! That rascal will only make you an imbecile!\\n Stick with me and...\\n you will gain a shortcut towards becoming the Fifth Hokage.\\n C'mon, let's go!\\n No way!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu\\n Wow! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFantastic!\\n Ha! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat's nothing.\\n I am a distinguished teacher.\\n I am not as weak as Mizuki.\\n Boss\\u2026\\n Transform!\\n Transform!\\n Oh, Master Ebisu\\u2026\\n I call it \\\"the Harem Jutsu\\\"!\\n He combined the Multiple Clones with his own Sexy Jutsu.\\n That's another devious attack.\\n I probably won't even survive that one.\\n I can't even beat that four-eyed teacher of mine!\\n I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly! I want to be recognized by everybody!\\n But I keep failing.\\n You think it's that easy?\\n Huh?\\n It's given only to the greatest Ninja in the village.\\n Everybody must learn to believe in you.\\n I've been through a lot already.\\n It's been one struggle after another.\\n But after all that, I found someone who accepts me.\\n I had to go through a lot... Just for one person.\\n You had better push yourself.\\n For what?\\n The path of getting the title, Lord Hokage, is a brutal one.\\n There's no such thing as a shortcut.\\n If you're really serious about attaining the title of Lord Hokage\\n You'll have to beat me first.\\n Who do you think you are, lecturing me like that?\\n I won't be your apprentice anymore.\\n From now on, you're my rival.\\n Unfortunately for you, tomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy.\\n Still, I'll consider you an equal someday when we fight for the title of Lord Hokage.\\n Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru.\\n You still have a long way to go to become a real Ninja.\\n Aaah! Why do I have to be in the same group with Sasuke?\\n The guy I hate the most?\\n Sakura keeps saying  \\\"Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!\\\"\\n and doesn't even pay attention to me!\\n It makes me so mad!

He's alive!\\n Humph! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tShow off\\u2026\\n Whaa--?!\\n Then, what was that\\u2026?\\n So Kakashi Sensei\\u2026used Substitutions\\u2026\\n Naruto\\u2026 Sorry I didn't help you right away\\u2026\\n I got you hurt.\\n I didn't think you'd be incapable of moving\\u2026\\n I was saved, somehow\\u2026\\n Anyhow, let me just say, good job, Sasuke.\\n You, too, Sakura.\\n I\\u2026couldn't do anything\\u2026\\n but Sasuke\\u2026\\n It was his first real battle\\u2026\\n Didn't he feel scared, at all?\\n He saved me like it was nothing and without getting any dirt on his clothes\\u2026\\n Hey\\u2026\\n Huh?!\\n Are you hurt\\u2026\\n scaredy cat...?\\n Sasuke!\\n Naruto!\\n These guys have poison on their claws.\\n You need to take out the poison quickly.\\n What?!\\n You have to open the wound and drain the poisoned blood.\\n Don't move so much.\\n The poison will spread.\\n By the way, Mr. Tazuna\\u2026\\n W-What is it\\u2026?!\\n I have something to talk to you about.\\n Chunin from the Village Hidden in the Mist\\u2026\\n These guys are Ninjas known for continuing to fight\\n no matter what the sacrifice.\\n How were you able to detect our movements?\\n There probably wouldn't be  puddles of water\\n on a clear day like today, when it hasn't rained for days.\\n Knowing that, why'd you leave it to the kids to fight?\\n If I felt like it, I could kill these guys instantly\\u2026\\n But\\u2026 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI had to know...\\n who the target of these enemies was\\u2026\\n Hm?! What do you mean?\\n In other words...\\n what I mean is I had to know if it was you,\\n or one of us Shinobi\\u2026 who was being targeted.\\n We haven't heard anything about you being targeted by Ninjas.\\n The content of the request was supposed to just be\\n protection from gangs, thieves, and the like\\u2026\\n This is a mission with a B rank or higher.\\n The request was supposed to be\\n for backup protection until you finished building your bridge\\u2026\\n If our enemies were to be Ninjas,\\n the mission would've been estimated without question\\n as an expensive  \\\"B Rank\\\"  mission.\\n It appears there's some kind of good reason for this,\\n but being lied to in the request won't do.\\n This is beyond the scope of our mission.\\n This mission is too soon for us\\u2026\\n Let's give it up!\\n We need an anesthetic to open Naruto's wound\\n and get out the poisoned blood\\u2026\\n We have to return to the village and take him to a doctor\\u2026\\n Hmmm\\u2026\\n Hm? What...?!\\n This sure is a burden!\\n Since we need to treat Naruto's wound, shall we go back to the village\\u2026?\\n Huh!\\n Oh!\\n Why am I so different?!\\n Why's it always me\\u2026 Darn it!\\n Naruto! What're you doing?!\\n I should be getting stronger\\u2026\\n Here I'm steadily carrying out missions and\\n doing special-skill training by myself every day\\u2026\\n I'll never get into another situation from which I'll have to be rescued.\\n I'll never be afraid or a be a coward\\u2026\\n I won't lose to Sasuke\\u2026\\n I'm going to swear on the pain of my left hand!\\n I'll protect you, old man\\u2026 with this Kunai knife!!\\n The mission continues!!\\n Naruto\\u2026\\n It's all well and good to rid yourself of the poisoned blood,\\n but any more than that and you'll bleed to death.\\n Things will get hairy if you don't stop the bleeding quick... Seriously!\\n Yikes!\\n Argh! No! No!\\n I can't die like this, I say!\\n Show me your hand.\\n Nooo! Help me!!\\n Naruto!\\n You're really self-abusive, aren't you!\\n That's masochistic!\\n The wound is\\u2026\\n already starting to heal\\u2026\\n Um\\u2026um\\u2026\\n Am I okay? You look awfully serious\\u2026\\n Well\\u2026You should be okay.\\n Is it\\u2026the power of the Nine-Tailed Fox\\u2026?\\n Did you say you failed?!\\n I paid a lot of money to hire you guys\\n because you said you were once hot-shot Ninjas!\\n Stop your darned grumbling\\u2026!!\\n Next time, I'll kill him with this\\u2026 head chopper!\\n I-It's really okay, right?!\\n It seems that the enemy has hired good Ninjas\\u2026\\n On top of that, a tightened guard on account of the Demon Brothers' failure\\n means that it won't be easy\\u2026\\n Just who do you think I am?!\\n This Zabuza Momochi, who is called the demon of\\u2026\\n the Hidden Mist!!\\n We've finally landed ashore in the Land of the Waves.\\n The guys before were all well and good,\\n but there should be even stronger guys lying in wait.\\n Okay! I'm going to regain my honor and continue the mission.\\n No matter what enemy comes,\\n I'll protect the old man this time around for sure.\\n Oh, they wasted no time.\\n An impressive-looking guy with a huge Katana has come.\\n Next episode:  \\\"The Assassin of the Mist!\\\"\\n I'm going to kick butt once again!\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ners\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
